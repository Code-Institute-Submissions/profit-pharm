### Introduction






## UX

As the name suggests Profit Pharm exists to work with independent community pharmacists throughout Ireland, 
so the market very niche also relatively small around 1700, of which maybe 50% are still truly independent. 
There are many others, known as “symbol” pahrmacies, who retain an independent name but are attached to the 
likes of Haven, Careplus and other similar groups. This has been exacerbated during this COVID period as   As a group, pharmacists have certain personality traits which need to be understood and addressed when presenting solutions of any sorts.
On the back of what for many has been their toughest ever, trying to get heads around “looking forward” has been challenging,however, hopefuuly there’s light at the end of the tunnel

### Owner goals

As the owner of Profit Pharm – my primary goal is to get engagement directly with the pharmacy owner. The business has most to offer when we get fully involved. 
Having set up our December – a true measure of the initial success of this site will be the number of attendees.
I want to develop new ways to win clients as our more traditional consultancy approach has more or less ceased to function
I want to develop an primary online business and be better placed to target the country as a whole
I want pharmacists to see Profit Pharm as a trusted partner
I really want to help those who have struggled to build their business to thrive in 2021 and beyond. This website is designed to promote contact and engagement.
I want pharmacists we work to believe they can derive more benefit working with Profit Pharm than being attached to a symbol brand


### Stories / Scenarios

As a busy pharmacist, I want to work with a trusted partner whilst retaining my business own identity.
I want to work with a company that’s genuinely interested in my business and helping us grow
I want to engage with other trusted partners through my association with Profit Pharm across a wide range of business areas.
It’s time to try something different – same old same old is gone
A common trait with all pharmacists but more especially independents is that they are hugely time poor – so they want to visit a site and get what they need in the minimum amount of time – will discuss this further later as it influenced a major design change.
As Profit Pharm grows, users will want to benefit with access to additional services and offerings
I want Profit Pharm to be able to engage directly with my managers and staff, so that it not always down to me…..obviously can only do this with a business I trust.
I need to grow the systems and skills in ,my business to stay ahead of the competition..

## Design

I had initially envisaged a four page site – with a landing page going straight to our event page – combined with an offer of a complimentary one hour business health in exchange for completion of business background questionnaire (page 4) with coloured coded sections relating to each “jigsaw” piece, so that a common visual theme could be kept from first vist to clicking the send button 
After I’d built it, it just looked to long and after a chat with my mentor and some thinking – I took some screen shots of the form and circulated them around a panels of pharmacists that have been clients. Initial suspicions were confirmed, it was too long…simply wouldn’t get that far into the site. 
So, following a review, I decided I could achieve the same, if not in fact, a better outcome using the modal solution linked directly to the event banner – so, I pulled page 4. 
Now that it’s built, its much better and as I mentioned earlier regarding the time pressures that pharmacist work under, the potential client or event attendee can visit the site - engage and register for the event in seconds. That what I need the site to do – get registrations – because that gives me and partners the opportunity to engage and create value scenarios….and win clients.


### Choices
I made a design choice to present the success model page as a single column -to me it made visiting that page clear and unambiguous, whilst enabling the user to engage with one subject at a time. I made some collateral pieces that the user can download and use – these are there to create the “this sites useful” feeling, plus it builds engagement for the future, it asks questions.
I built the intro video purely to capture attention and curiosity – asks a question, then the linked click page takes you to a potential solution. If a pharmacist watches it, I guarantee they will subconsciously pick an area they know they have a potential issue with.
I’ve built the site to promote engagement and as such all the phone numbers and emails are live, so, literally touch the number on the phone screen and you’re connected – makes it really easy to do – right there and then.

## Wireframes

I sketched ideas out initially fairly quickly as this project cam e upon me way earlier than I wanted it to, so was great to get ideas out.
I put them into Balsamic and the remaining three pages and the landing have stayed reasonably tru, although I felt that each day, I was thinking of different ideas and things to do

## Fonts

I went with Roboto, as it is one of Google preferred UI interfaces and I wanted the best contrast esp on mobile devices. Went with Exo for card headers as I liked the shape, the characters being slightly taller for their width
