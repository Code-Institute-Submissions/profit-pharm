### Introduction

Profit Pharm is a business owned by me - I've had it on the go for a few years and I kind off turn it up and down as needs demand. However, with the effect COVID has had on community pharmacy along with changes in everyone's working practices, I believe the time is right to lead the change and get engaged with community pharmacy, but in a different way....

So, this website is the first step to building a different sort of business in 2021 -


## UX

As the name suggests Profit Pharm exists to work with independent community pharmacists throughout Ireland, 
so the market very niche also relatively small around 1700, of which maybe 50% are still truly independent. 
There are many others, known as “symbol” pharmacies, who retain an independent name but are attached to the 
likes of Haven, Careplus and other similar groups. This has been exacerbated during this COVID period.
As a group, pharmacists have certain personality traits which need to be understood and addressed when presenting solutions of any sorts.
On the back of what for many has been their toughest ever, 
trying to get heads around “looking forward” has been challenging,however, hopefully there’s light at the end of the tunnel

### Owner goals

As the owner of Profit Pharm – my primary goal is to get engagement directly with the pharmacy owner. The business has most to offer when we get fully involved. 
Having set up our December event – a true measure of the initial success of this site will be the number of attendees.

I want to develop new ways to win clients as our more traditional consultancy approach has more or less ceased to function since COVID

I want to develop an primary online business and be better placed to target the country as a whole
I want pharmacists to see Profit Pharm as a trusted partner

I really want to help those who have struggled to build their business to thrive in 2021 and beyond. This website is designed to promote contact and engagement.

I want pharmacists we work to believe they can derive more benefit working with Profit Pharm than being attached to a symbol brand


### Stories / Scenarios

As a busy pharmacist, I want to work with a trusted partner whilst retaining my business own identity.

I want to work with a company that’s genuinely interested in my business and helping us grow.

I want to engage with other trusted partners through my association with Profit Pharm across a wide range of business areas.
It’s time to try something different – same old same old is gone

A common trait with all pharmacists but more especially independents is that they are hugely time poor – so they want to visit a site and get what they need in the minimum amount of time – will discuss this further later as it influenced a major design change.

As Profit Pharm grows, users will want to benefit with access to additional services and offerings.

I want Profit Pharm to be able to engage directly with my managers and staff, so that it not always down to me…..obviously can only do this with a business I trust.

I need to grow the systems and skills in my business to stay ahead of the competition..

## Design

I had initially envisaged a four page site – with a landing page going straight to our event page – combined with an offer of a complimentary one hour business health in exchange for completion of business background questionnaire (page 4) with coloured coded sections relating to each “jigsaw” piece, so that a common visual theme could be kept from first vist to clicking the send button 

After I’d built it, it just looked to long and after a chat with my mentor and some thinking – I took some screen shots of the form and circulated them around a panels of pharmacists that have been clients. Initial suspicions were confirmed, it was too long…simply wouldn’t get that far into the site.

So, following a review, I decided I could achieve the same, if not in fact, a better outcome using the modal solution linked directly to the event banner – so, I pulled page 4. 

Now that it’s built, its much better and as I mentioned earlier regarding the time pressures that pharmacist work under, the potential client or event attendee can visit the site - engage and register for the event in seconds. That what I need the site to do – get registrations – because that gives me and partners the opportunity to engage and create value scenarios….and win clients.


### Choices
I made a design choice to present the success model page as a single column -to me it made visiting that page clear and unambiguous, whilst enabling the user to engage with one subject at a time. 

I made some collateral pieces that the user can download and use – these are there to create the “this sites useful” feeling, plus it builds engagement for the future, it asks questions.

I built the intro video purely to capture attention and curiosity – asks a question, then the linked click page takes you to a potential solution. If a pharmacist watches it, I guarantee they will subconsciously pick an area they know they have a potential issue with.

I’ve built the site to promote engagement and as such all the phone numbers and emails are live, so, literally touch the number on the phone screen and you’re connected – makes it really easy to do – right there and then.

## Wireframes

I sketched ideas out initially fairly quickly as this project came upon me way earlier than I wanted it to following change to my original project, so was great to get ideas out.

I put them into Balsamic and the remaining three pages and the landing have stayed reasonably true, although I felt that each day, I was thinking of different ideas and things to do

## Fonts

I went with Roboto, as it is one of Google preferred UI interfaces and I wanted the best contrast esp on mobile devices. Went with Exo for card headers as I liked the shape, the characters being slightly taller for their width

## Colour Palette
Colour choice was based on the colours used by a leading Irish Pharmacy magazine – see pic. Most pharmacists see this once a month, atrusted publication. The idea is to lead the pharmacist, in a subliminal way, to think that it’s something they already recognise and trust. 

I like the mix myself and have designed artwork for pharmacies using these color combinations. I like the contrast.

I also created the background image for the site – I layered a very dark green on top to match the generel theme,

## Technologies

### Languages

During the building of this site the following languages and frameworks were used
HTML5

CSS3

Icons from Font Awesome

Fonts from Google

Bootstrap was used for the main structure – having been introduced to it, it seemed the most expedient way to get a structure built as I was under time pressure. A learning from this however is I will learn CSS flex and grid as I feel it may better suit my creative style.

The only Javascript used is to complete the modal cycle.

Tinypng was used to reduce picture weight.




### Tools

Git – to manage version control through committing and pushing via cloud to repository
Again, a learning for me is to adapt my work style to review and commit and push more often – my default position has always been immersive – so, I need to change my work habits foing forward

Github – aforementioned repository for all created material and projects.

Microsoft Powerpoint -my “go to” design platform – used to build video, background images, download materials

Balsamiq – wireframes

Am I responsive for the “live” images

W3C Validators to validate both HTML and CSS code to check for errors

Google fonts – fonts

Font Awesome for icons

## Features
Entry to the site is via a short video. As I mentioned ealrier, the motivation behind this is to simply get another second or two of engagement and pique curiosity. I think it's engaging - asks a question

I think once past that, users will enjoy the look and convenience of the home page, I've also placed a drop down on the navbar giving access to materials - get used to getting stuff from Profit Pharm website quickly.

Having asked the question with the video - my hope is that they'll immediately see an answer in the form of the event.....click and register quickly. I also load some other links so that users can find ouit more.ie the Trading online voucher link appears a couple of times in the site.......again,  a useful resource.

If users do have questions - the contact page will handle that - bearing a GDPR minimimum statement and the option to sign up for a newsletter.....

Rearding the Success model page - I've placed a couple of download links within the page, so, if they haven't time to digest it all - the may take dow n the worksheet and come back to it.

Branding is on view throughout the site and discreet in the background image - so, not overpowering.

As this is for MS1, there is no method or post attached to the send buttons.


### Evolution

In terms of what the plan is for the site......ultimately I want to create a subscription based participation business- run online mostly. I somehow think that returning to the way things were will not be happening anytime soon. 

So,the event in December is reallythe start of the process to launch the "members" site perhaps in the Spring of next year........ the idea is, for a reasonable monthly subscription - members get exclusive access to training materials, regular webinars, access to preferred partners and a range of other benfits. 

The website should become a platform for this,  hope a platform for training delivery, interaction and potentially a forum were pharmacists can meet and discuss pertinent issues and bounce of each other.....this doesn't exist at the minute




## SEO
Effective SEO is vital to the progress of this site.
In terms of the site itself - each page has a title - a minimum quite requirement for google search
also - have description and keywords in trhe meta area in the headers
Once the site goes live - google analytics will be embedded and generate quality information which will help steer the future direction of site development.

In addition, I will use embed Hotjar code into the site - so, will actually be able to watch "over the should video" of user visits. I'll also use Mouseflow once the site get a bit bigger to monitor mouse click journey during user site visits, again all with a view to maximising each visit and generate engagement and future clients.

[](https//:www.mousflow.com "Mouseflow")

All this information will be review regularly, so that adjustments can be made quickly.




## Testing
I've tested the site for responsiveness through variou scenarios using Chrome Dev tools. No major issues. In addition, I've teated it on a variety of different browsers that I have access to - Edge, Firefox, Opera and also four other live devices - Microsoft Surface 3, A Toshiba 10" laptop - and 7 and 10 inch tablets running stock Android - 

As mentioned earlier - there no activity linked to the send buttons on the contact form, I have tested all the links within the site and the work perfectly.

I have tested the live phone number.....there are two on there - one is mine, the other is made up and the live one works across both iPhone and Android

In addition, I've tested both HTML and CSS through the W3C validator - link below. No issue with the CSS.

 I did get a message on HTML. It was regarding having the property "no-loop" on the video, which they didn't seem to happy with.
The reason that is there is to enable the video to stop so that people can click the screen when they see they find out more button. In reality, the whole screen is clickable...just an eye trick with the button.

It was the only way I could get the idea to do what I needed it to do - in the absence of being able to use a preloader as it's outwith the scope of this project cycle.

I did do some user testing - as I mentioned - I sent screen shots of the various pages to half a dozen pharmacists whose opinion I would value. I gave them the background to the site development and what the plan was for the future. Generally, they thought it sounded very positve - apart from filling isn a long online form!!! So, that's encouraging.

I also tested contrast on wave - and whilst the green and near black, do look great to me - apparently wave thought it wasn't a great combination. I'll stick with it for the meantime - if I get user feedback that it's an issue, I may consider adjusting it further down the road.




## Issues
There were no major issues during testing. There were a few issues during the development of the site, however these were ironed out with minor changes to property values. As this is my first coding experience - I did suffer a bit with "You don't know what you don't know" - so, whilst I could see the nature of an issue, sometimes it took quite a while to work out - that's learning. I think I could type the words "How do I....? with my eyes closed!!



## Deployment
To deploy this page to GitHub pages I followed this process:-

Logged into GitHub from my Chrome browser

selected the Profit Pharm repo Richard-Kelly920/profit-pharm

using the nav bar on top, clicked and scrolled down to the Github pages section.

select Branch Master - then Root and click on Save - this generates the URL for the site and voila! the websitew on gitpages in now live.





## Cloning
If you want to run my project on your local machine - then work always

Cloning is pretty simple

again - as before, get into GitHub
find the repo Richard-Kelly920/profit-pharm
click the green Code dropdown button select "open with GitHub from here follow the steps show and open in GitHUb or your IDE of choice




## Credits

### Images and Content
The content of the site was written by myself.
In addition - I built the video, background image and all the jigsaws piece images.

The picture of me was taken by Martin McLaclan, KIlmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland

The background image used in the Jumbtron was purchased for use by myself from Dreamtime. It was the perfect combination of colour and harmony with the message - seemed worth the value.



Acknowledgments
 A huge shout out to the people on Slack - I haven't been on there that often -(something else that needs to change as I head into the world of Javascript)
 especially Jim and Anna for thier abundant approach in preparing and delivering fantastic content - 

 also to Code Institute for the materials and inspiration I took for the walk through projects. It was amazing to see stuff evolve. I believe at some point it will sink in.

 My mentor Spencer Barribal for his input and support - much appreciated

 also - just the general world of coding - being new to the environment - it's refreshing to see and hopefully participate in such a community.
