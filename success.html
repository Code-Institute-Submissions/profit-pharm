<h2>Our Success Model</h2>
<p> Our "Jigsaw" successful is at the core of what we do. When we take on a new client, the first thing we do is to establish a current position in each area. This then gives a benchmark from which to move forward. When all the pieces are joined together, real success can happen - if you've one piece missing - there will always be something holding you back. To get the most from this page, you could download our worksheet and make notes as you read through. <br>Download our Success Model worksheet

                 When we start working with a new client, the first activity we undertake is to establish exactly what the vision is for the business. We really get into deep levels of detail, because, from a business owners perspective, the vision you have for your business is the most important component to being successful. Once the vision is firmly established, it then forms the basis of the planning process and everything that follows thereafter. Success is a planned activity, it doesn’t happen by accident.
                     Vision – it all starts here.</p>

              From Vision we go to people – your staff. Consider the questions above – you can’t deliver the goals you have without staff so, it makes sense to share your vision for the business with them. You then need to review the skills within the team. Do they have the skills required to deliver? If not, are they trainable skills? Training and development through skills audit and performance review is a must. This brings about a stakeholder philosophy with staff being accountable in a positive way for the outcomes. Becomes more than “just a job”.</p>
              
               <p class="card-text-reflect"> Do you regularly review staff performance?<br> Do you discuss the business with the staff and state clearly what their part in it's success will be?</p>

              Marketing is such a huge area – not enough space here. Some basics are that for most “small” businesses marketing is one or two activities that generally fall on one person to do. If they are unable to do stuff and with fewer staff, this is often the case – then it becomes a fairly stop-start thing. At Profit Pharm – we coach up to ten channels of activity – this way, your reliance on only one or two activities is less. <br>Obviously, we have to take about digital – and with footfall down or non-existent, the importance of a fantastic joined-up digital strategy cannot be stressed enough. By the way, if you don’t have a website or even if you do – Local Enterprise Boards are still offering their <a href="https://www.localenterprise.ie/Discover-Business-Supports/Trading-Online-Voucher-Scheme-/">Trading Online voucher scheme</a>  which offer up to €2500 available to develop e-commerce in your business. Since COVID – the business contribution has been dropped to 10% from 50%, so, worth checking out – we have helped many businesses with applications for this, so, please contact us if you need more information or help.</p>

              Once you’ve got your marketing machine hooked and producing – you are going to bring in a lot of new customers. The key message here – and if it’s the only thing you do - is work on your customer retention strategies to ensure you really benefit from new business. Too many businesses throw money at gaining new business and then do little or nothing to keep the customers coming back. Everyone is a shopper – and they only become a customer when they come back time and again because you have asked them to.<br><br> Customer churn is hugely expensive and with footfall down and online booming – keeping customers is harder than ever. Positive initiatives such as Healthmail may have a downside in as much as “traditional” customers which form the major part of community pharmacy revenue now have “don’t leave the house” alternatives. It’s a bit of a mantra for us -Retention – Retention – Retention – the only way to achieve true business growth.,</p>

              <p class="card-text-success">
              Business is about making a profit – and for most high street businesses – the key measure of a day to day basis is what goes through the till. In a busy pharmacy – it can be hard to keep on top of all the areas of the business that cost money to run. Generally, these are only seriously reviewed when the annual accounts are produced and “Cost of Sales” is a real number. In the current climate – front of shop sales, which help in some way to offset the constant attrition on fees and drug prices, are practically non-existent. Add to this that increase in running costs this year and the profit number is under pressure.<br> At Profit Pharm we review all aspects of the business with a focus on increasing sales – ie more customers – more profit -but also those areas where benefits gained on the sales revenue side can disappear quickly. It’s keythere fore to have strategies the drives sales revues up and costs down. Imagine the positive effect if you could save just 10% across 5 areas of your business.</p>

              <p class="card-text-success">
              The last piece of the jigsaw is to look at systems. Throughout our process we have discussed what strategies you have in place to do lots of things – get and retain customers – manage costs – review staff. It’s the combination of all these areas that bring the real growth. However, like anything, real life takes over and the best laid plans etc etc. This is why it’s vitally important that you try to systemise as many of the activities that make the business run as possible. Have systems in place to get new customers – do staff review – review costs. If it require people to run them all they time – then that’s the weakest point. Systemise the routine – Humanise the exception.</p>
